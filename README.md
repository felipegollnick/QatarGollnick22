A World Cup Predictions Game developed on Power BI

The aim was to develop a full project running mainly on Power BI while having real and brand new data that I have collected from real people.
Qatar Gollnick 22 happened while the World Cup action unfolded. Results were updated everyday, and so participants were informed about their updated standings and other interesting facts.

I needed to do all the steps in a proccess that went far beyond than the just the dashboard developing. Some of the main steps involved: 
- Data Cleaning;
- Data Modelling;
- DAX measures and M language;
- Data Visualization (Power BI and Flourish);
- User Experience;
- Customer Service and Community Moderating (as I used WhatsApp groups to update participants about their results and standings);
- And, before all of that, I had to look for participants who would be part of the game; Then I had to come up with questionnaires where they would send their guesses.

I have also designed the logo of the game.

You can read about the whole developing proccess [on my page on Medium](https://datagollnick.medium.com/). (still working in an English version of it)

Beside of the dashboard you can access on the above URL, I used Flourish to make an interactive data visualization of how the standings unfolded day by day.

Updates were daily. But the grand final of the FIFA World Cup is a whole different game (pun intended). For this match, I would award much more points to the participant with the right guess than in the other matches.
So, on each goal, I updated the participants' standings. Here's another Flourish animation showing how the action unfolded.
